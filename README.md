## Topic
For our project, we decided to analyze road accidents in France from the years 2005 to 2016. 

## Issues or questions we are addressing
We are interested in seeing whether certain regions of France have more crashes than others and
whether more crashes occur during certain times of day. Additionally, we will investigate how road
conditions, weather, vehicle type, age range, and other relevant variables affect the lethality
of these crashes

## Source of data
We obtained our data from Kaggle, which is a virtual repository with thousands of real-world data sets 
available for free; the exact url address is:
*https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedlahlou/accidents-in-france-from-2005-to-2016*

## Statistical techniques we will be using
We will be creating a logistic ridge regression to create a classification model capable of predicting
whether or not any given crash will be fatal given certain environmental and situational factors. We will
train the model on half of the data set and test it on the other half. We hope to achieve classification accuracy
in excess of 75%. We will also create heatmaps and other visualizations to assist in illustrating the relationships
found within this data set.
